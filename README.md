# Backpropagation

This code solves the backpropagation XOR problem, but it can be easily adjusted to solve the AND/OR problems. 

## Context

Backpropagation is a fundamental concept in the field of artificial neural networks and machine learning. It is an optimization algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting the weights of the network's connections, aiming to minimize the error between predicted and actual output
